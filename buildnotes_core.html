A number of problems related to case-sensitivity on Windows file systems
have been addressed.&nbsp; Users will notice new support for re-casing
files (e.g., foo.java => Foo.java), detection of naming conflicts, detection
of external re-casing, etc.&nbsp; By-in-large the user's experience should
match that of the standard Windows explorer.&nbsp; There are however a
number of cases where it is infeasible for the platform to reconcile the
differences between the case-sensitive resource tree and the case-insensitive
filesystem. In most of these situations there exists usage patterns which
allow users to accomplish their tasks.</li>

The previous implementation of IWorkspace.computePrerequisiteOrder() would
sometimes include additional projects in the result. This issue has been
corrected such that the prerequisite list returned contains only those
projects requested.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Other highlights"></a>Other highlights</h3>

<ul>
<li>
A number of resource operations (e.g., copy, move, setContents, delete)
incorporate a "free" refresh local operation if the supplied force flag
is set to false. This is an effort on the part of the resources plugin
to efficiencently and effectively keep up to date with the state of the
filesystem even when there are no filesystem callbacks/notifications. Unfortunately,
the behaviour has some undesirable side-effects whereby clients are told
they are out of sync and then go and look only to find that they are in-sync
(because a free refresh was being done by the workspace). This is especially
true in the area of editors and setContents.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>To address these issues, the resources plugin no longer does a free
refresh local in the following operations:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IResource.move/copy/delete
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IFile.setContents/appendContents
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IFile.create
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IFolder.create</pre>
Client code which uses force=true should not be affected by these changes.
Client code which passes force=false may have to be updated if subsequent
resource manipulations were expecting to succeed based on the free refreshLocal
of some preceding operation. Clients wishing to synchronize their resources
should use IResource.refreshLocal explicitly.</ul>

Under certain conditions the history store may become corrupt.&nbsp; In
these cases the platform will flush the store and as a result, the history
for the related project will be lost. Current file content is not affected.&nbsp;
The cause of the history store corruption is currently unknown but will
be addressed in future releases.</li>

<li>
The platform was not handling correctly relative locations passed to -platform.
It affect the location of all resources in the ResourcesPlugin. Any relative
locations passed in the -platform command line are now interpreted as relative
to the user.dir Java property.</li>

<li>
The semantics for IWorkspace.move has changed. It used to NOT keep history
for files. It now keeps history.</li>

<li>
The eclipse shell scripts and the startup.jar have been moved to be in
a stand-alone bin directory.&nbsp; This better matches the intended shipping
structure.</li>

<li>
IProject.move(IProjectDescription, boolean, IProgressMonitor) now allows
the user to specify a description with the same name and a different location.
The results will be that the project content will be moved to the new location.</li>

ILibrary and LibraryModel objects recently had type and source fields added

"source".&nbsp; The source type and the source field were an ill-fated

<ul>
<li>
The organization of the boot loader has been made more flexible so that
in self-hosting scenarios, it is no longer necessary to specify the -boot
...&nbsp; on the command line when running the target.</li>

<li>
If the user specifies -refresh on the command line, when the ResourcesPlugin
is started a local refresh is done on the workspace root. This will discover
any changes made in the filesystem while the workspace was shut down, and
propagate the changes to the workspace tree. Classes which take advantage
of the ISaveParticipant facilities will be notified of these changes when
their plugin becomes activated. This operation is potentially very costly
and users should note this when considering its use.</li>

<ul>
<li>
IFile.getContents( true ) does not run anymore a refresh local if the file
is out of sync. It just returns a stream with the file's contents either
if it is in sync or not.</li>

<li>
The spec for ICommand#getArguments and ICommand#setArguments says that
the arguments can be null. The implementation didn't allow for this (instead
it used an empty map to indicate lack of arguments). The implementation
has been updated to match the spec.</li>

<li>
An assertion failure used to be thrown when an operation was done during
event notifications. But the spec says that a CoreException should be thrown
instead. The implementation now matches the API. No API changes.</li>

<li>
The infrastructure for notifying listeners of IResourceChangeEvents has
been extended to include two new notification points.&nbsp; Clients can
now register listeners for notification before and after auto-builds. In
both cases, the resource tree is open for change during this notification.
There are a number of caveats associated with these new events and clients
are advised to take special care when using these new features.</li>

<li>
Note, that the internal URI scheme used by eclipse for access to installation
directories, etc is being renamed. Any code that hardcodes "eclipse:" will
need to change. The correct usage is NOT to create these internal URLs
directly (via new URL(String)) because the internal URI scheme is not documented
API. Instead the user should always use the APIs provided by various classes
in the platform for this purpose (eg. IPluginDescriptor.getInstallURL(),
BootLoader.getInstallUL(), IInstallInfo.getComponentInstallURLFor(String),
etc).</li>

<ul>
<li>
Paths containing multiple leading parent references (e.g., ../../../foo)
were incorrectly canonicalized to remove all but one of the leading references
(e.g., ../foo).&nbsp; This has been corrected to leave all leading parent
references.</li>

<li>
The order of the arguments in the constructor for com.ibm.dav4j.http.client.Response
have changed.</li>

<li>
When defining their own marker types, users are encouraged to use the "name"
attribute for the extension to define a human readable string for their
marker which potentially may be presented to the user.</li>

<li>
New API has been added for accessing the command line used to start the
Platform (see Platform.getCommandLineArgs()).&nbsp; This returns the entire
command line as provided to the platform launcher.&nbsp; Individual applications
(IPlatformRunnables) may receive a different set of command line arguments
depending on how they were run.&nbsp; See BootLoader.run() and BootLoader.startup()
for more information.</li>

<h3>
<a NAME="API changes"></a>API changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>
API for representing and getting information about the install has been
added.</li>

<li>
Updated spec to explicitly say that changes to markers and sync information
do not appear in build deltas but they do appear in notification deltas.</li>

<li>
The Ant support plugin now supports the specification of Ant tasks, datatypes
and 'objects' in extension contributions to extension-points on the Ant
plugin. There are also several new datatypes and tasks which improve the
integration of Ant into the Platform and compensate for problems with Ant.</li>

<li>
IProject#delete and IWorkspaceRoot#delete have been clarified to specify
that sync information is deleted when you delete the resource.</li>

<li>
Method 'resolve' moved from Factory to PluginRegistryModel.&nbsp; The new
resolve returns an IStatus giving all problems found during the resolve
rather than listing these problems in the factory's status.</li>

<li>
Main.main() and UIMain.main() have been updated to use the value returned
from running the application as the value passed to System.exit if the
value is an Integer.&nbsp; This allows the platform to return status/completion
codes to the calling entity.</li>

<li>
Resources and Runtime structures are now clones as the API specs. Most
of the classes in the Resources and Runtime plug-ins spec that some of
the structures they return are copies and not the real ones. The implementation
was not always conforming to the API. So, users of these classes relying
on behavior instead of API might have unexpected problems in their code.</li>

<li>
To address the issue of UI/Workspace deadlock, the platform now supports
a "-avoidDeadlock" command-line argument.&nbsp; Using this enables the
new deadlock avoidance mechanism.&nbsp; This mode should be considered
experimental for now but in the very near future will be included as standard
and this command line option will be removed.&nbsp; Users encountering
deadlock problems should enable this option.&nbsp; If the problems persist,
you are encouraged to report your usecase so that the issue can be resolved.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Added API for moving/copying projects to folders and vice versa.</li>

<li>
Class loading has been improved to ensure that plug-in activation is not
done in a synchronized block.&nbsp; The previous behavior could cause deadlock
in some conditions.</li>

<li>
ISafeRunnable.handleException( Exception ) is now SafeRunnable.handleException(
Throwable ). Implementors of this interface have to change their code.
LinkageErrors are now logged by the Platform and passed to handleException().</li>

<li>
IFile.getContents( true ) does not synchronize the file anymore if called
from inside an IResourceChangeListener during a resource change notification.
This behaviour was erroneous since resource changes are not allowed during
change notifications.</li>

<li>
Added IProjectDescription#hasNature to be consistent.</li>

<li>
Calling IWorkspace.run() after the ResourcesPlugin has been shutdown causes
a CoreException to be thrown.</li>

<li>
Builds were triggering auto builds. These behaviour was not the correct
one.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Other highlights"></a>Other highlights</h3>

<ul>To improve support for development time execution of the platform,
the the information in the .va.properties file previously associated with
the plugins should now be incorporated in a plugin.jars file. The file
has entries corresponding to each of the <tt>&lt;library></tt> elements
in the plugin.xml. Each defined property is of form:
<ul><tt>libname=source1,source2,source3,...</tt></ul>

<p><br>For example:
<p>plugin.xml
<ul><tt>&lt;runtime></tt>
<ul><tt>&lt;library name=baseapi.jar></tt>
<ul><tt>&lt;export name="*"/></tt></ul>
<tt>&lt;/library></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;library name=another.jar/></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;library name=base.jar/></tt></ul>
<tt>&lt;/runtime></tt></ul>

<p><br>plugin.jars
<ul><tt>baseapi.jar=Base API Project</tt>
<br><tt>base.jar=Base Project 1, Base Project 2</tt></ul>

<p><br>If running in JDK with -dev mode configured, the above results in
a loader search path consisting of:
<ul><tt>Base API Project, baseapi.jar, another.jar, Base Project 1, Base
Project 2, base.jar</tt></ul>

<p><br>Any library access filters specified in the plugin.xml are applied
to the corresponding loader search path entries.</ul>

IWorkspace.save( false ) used to throw a CoreException if called from inside
an IWorkspaceRunnable. It now only acts as a hint that a snapshot was requested.

Support for Ant has been added to the platform.&nbsp; Users are now able

<ul>
<li>
The API for IFile.getHistory says&nbsp; "Recently added states first."
but the implementation was giving back the oposite order. It is now fixed.</li>

<li>
To reduce brittleness in the core.runtime.model package, the interfaces
have been removed leaving only the default implementation classes.&nbsp;
These classes can be extended by clients.&nbsp; This will help cushion
downstream developers from future changes in the plugin.xml DTD. Related
methods (e.g., Platform.parsePlugins()) which mention the deleted interfaces
have also changed.</li>

<li>
When used with older workspaces under NTFS, it is possible that all resources
appear to be out of sync. This is a result of the finer granularity we
are now getting to represent the last modified time of a resource.&nbsp;
In addition, Daylight Saving Time problems on Windows are also fixed.</li>

<ul>
<li>
new Path ("./") incorrectly returns Path.ROOT. This is incorrect since
ROOT isAbsolute()&nbsp; and does not hasTrailingSeparator().&nbsp; Clearly
"./" is both relative and does have a trailing separator.&nbsp; The implementation
has been updated to return the path "./" as this best fits the characteristics
of the original.&nbsp; java.io.File handles this new form in all cases
tested.&nbsp; Users of Path may wish to confirm their uses to ensure their
path math is still correct.</li>

<li>
The core no longer dictates the VCM API to use.&nbsp; As a result, all
VCM API packages have been removed from the resources plugin and the getVCMProvider()
api and vcmprovider extension point has been removed.</li>

<li>
IProject.removeNature used to throw an exception if the nature did not
exist. Now it just returns.</li>

<li>
IProject.getNature used to throw an exception if the nature was not added
to the project. It now returns null.</li>

<li>
The format for defining the transient/persistent attribute of a marker
definition has changed. Users are now to specify that they want their marker
to be persisted by using &lt;persistent=true> in their marker definition,
rather than &lt;transient=false>.</li>

<li>
Added IWorkspace#validateProjectLocation so users are able to pre-check
whether or not a particular location is valid for a project which they
are going to create.</li>

<li>
Added IMarker#setAttributes(Map).</li>

<li>
Adding and removing natures are now operations that show up in project
deltas. They show up as a content change.</li>

The Platform now supports the specification of additional plugin classpath

relative to the plugin's install location</li>

<li>
IContainer#getFile and IContainer#getFolder have changed. Previously if
the path argument was absolute then the full path of the receiver had to
be a prefix. In order to remain consistent with other API calls, the path
argument is considered to be relative to the receiver, whether it is absolute
or not.</li>

The class BaseBuilder has been renamed "IncrementalProjectBuilder" to better
emphasize that builders are per-project and intended to be incremental.&nbsp;
BaseBuilder now subclasses IncrementalProjectBuilder and is deprecated.</li>

Persistent properties were spec'd as being XML to facilitate some server

this restriction can be relaxed.&nbsp; the PT_PROPERTIES constant has been

The workspace tree is locked for all delta notifications. If listeners

<ul>
<li>
The platform now supports the computing of a plug-in path and parsing of
plug-in definitions from user code.&nbsp; This support is intended for
tool developers needing to inspect the plug-ins installed on a particular
platform.&nbsp; See Platform.parsePlugins() and BootLoader.getPluginPath().</li>

<li>
Plugins often need to call other plugins.&nbsp; In doing so they run the
risk of being corrupted by failures in the plugin being called.&nbsp; ISafeRunnable
and Platform.run() provide a mechanism by which plugins can protect themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This code should be used by all plugins when calling untrusted code.</li>

<li>
IWorkspace#checkpoint() was deprecated and has been replaced with IWorkspace#checkpoint(boolean).
The boolean parameter is used to indicate whether or not a build should
be run.</li>

<li>
The notion of a MIME type on a resource has been removed from the core
since it was unclear that it usefully solved a large number of problems.&nbsp;
All related implementations have been deprecated.</li>

<li>
The API for IMarker#getId and IMarkerDelta#getId has changed so that the
return type of the methods is a long, rather than an int.</li>

<li>
Updated IMarker#getAttributes spec to say that return value is null if
there are no attributes.</li>

<li>
VCM repository adapter API: A new package com.ibm.eclipse.core.vcm.adapter
has been created for the repository adapter API. Repository adapter implementations
need to be separate plug-ins that provide an exectuable extension to the
'adapters' extension point of the VCM plug-in. The executable extension
must be a class which implements IRepositoryAdapterFactory. A method getType()
has been added to this interface.</li>

<li>
Repository adapter API: The signature of IRepositoryAdapter.release() has
been changed so that implementations don't need to downcast to internal
classes of the VCM plugin.</li>

<ul>
<li>
Repository adapter API - renamed getProjectVersionWorkspace to getProjectVersion
and getTeamStreamProjectWorkspace to getTeamStreamProject; simplified the
signature of getFileHistory and getProjectHistory.</li>

<li>
The API on IProjectDescription and IProject has been rationalized. The
net result is that descriptions are stand-alone (e.g., when manipulated
before project creation) and all modifications to a project are done directly
on the project after creation.&nbsp; The changes are summarized below:</li>

<ul>
<li>
Modifying operations on IProject will now cause a build and as such require
a progress monitor</li>

<li>
newMapping and newDescription moved from IProject to IWorkspace</li>

<li>
various methods from IProjectDescription now appear on IProject as well</li>
</ul>

<li>
The IMarker API has been relaxed such that the getAttribute(String, *)
methods no longer throw CoreException.&nbsp; In cases where either the
marker does not exist or the attribute is not found, the supplied default
value is returned.</li>

<br>In an effort to standardize the representation of markers on text resources
the marker type IMarker.TEXT has been added.&nbsp; In addition, name and
semantic definitions for IMarker.CHAR_START, CHAR_END and LINE_NUMBER.&nbsp;
Text related markers should subtype this new marker type in addition to
any other marker types required.
<li>
Added new API for IProject#move and IProject#copy to take the IProjectDescription
of the destination. This allows the user to set up the resource mappingson
the destination before the copy/move is done.</li>

<li>
The methods IResource.getExtendedType() and setExtendedType() have been
deprecated and replaced with get/setMimeType() to better match the future
directions of the platform.</li>

<li>
Repository adapter API: removed ServerResource.getPath; changed return
type of ServerResource.fetchStateId to be IStateId; renamed RepositoryAdapter.refresh
to .getRemoteTree; removed RepositoryAdapter.createTeamStreamProject. Note
that ServerResource.fetchMembers and .fetchMemberNames will likely be moved
to ServerWorkspace soon.</li>

<h2>
<a NAME="What's new"></a>What's new in this drop</h2>

<h3>
<a NAME="API changes"></a>API changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Changed IWorkspace#addSaveParticipant so it now throws a CoreException.</li>

<li>
Added ISaveContext#getFiles, ISaveContext#lookup, and ISaveContext#map.</li>

<li>
Deprecated ISaveContext#getPlugin.</li>

<li>
Added ISavedState#lookup and ISavedState#map.</li>

<li>
Changed ISaveParticipant#doneSaving and ISaveParticipant#rollback so they
no longer throw a CoreException.</li>

<li>
Changed comment in ISaveContext#needDelta.</li>

<li>
The API around IContainer.findMember() and IContainer.exists() was inconsistent
in its handling of the supplied path.&nbsp; The spec for findMember() has
been updated to always treat the given path as relative to the container.&nbsp;
This change may affect user who were calling this method with an absolute
path.&nbsp; These users should use IWorkspace.getRoot().findMember().</li>

<li>
VCM API - The notion of transient resources has been replaced by its negative,
managed resources. See ISharingManager.manage. Note that newly created
resources are unmanaged by default; they have to be put under version and
configuration management explicitly.</li>

<li>
VCM API - The meaning of one of the boolean parameters passed to ISharingManager.load
has changed, see the spec for details.</li>

<li>
Added IFile.appendContents.</li>

<li>
The Platform now declares constants on IMarker to define the various standard
markers attributes and standard values where applicable.</li>

<li>
The NullProgressMonitor provided by the Runtime plugin was implemented
incorrectly with a singleton. NullProgressMonitor#getInstance was used
to get the singleton. This method has been deprecated and users should
call the public constructor to create a new NullProgressMonitor.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Other highlights"></a>Other highlights</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The VCM implementation and the internal preliminary repository adapter
API has been improved.</li>

<h3>
<a NAME="API changes"></a>API changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Added IMarkerDelta#isSubtypeOf and IMarker#isSubtypeOf to tell if the type
of the marker is a subtype of the specified type.</li>

<li>
Added IMarker#getAttributes() which returns a Map of attribute names to
attribute values.</li>

<br>The "exclusive" boolean parameter in IResource#findMarkers, IResource#deleteMarkers,
and IResource#removeMarkers was deemed confusing and has been renamed to
be "includeSubtypes". The meaning behind this parameter name is the opposite
of its predecessor, and therefore users calling these methods should reverse
their boolean logic.
<li>
Added new attribute convenience methods to IMarker and IMarkerDelta. See
the appropriate interfaces for more information.</li>

<li>
Removed unused constant IMarker.UNDEFINED.</li>

<li>
Added convenience methods on IMarkerDelta to get the type and attributes
of the marker. See the interface for details.</li>

<li>
Added IVCMEvent, IVCMListener, and methods in IVCMProvider for registering
and de-registering VCM event listeners.</li>

<h2>
<a NAME="What's new"></a>What's new in this drop</h2>

<h3>
<a NAME="API changes"></a>API changes</h3>

<ul>
<li>
The API related to markers has undergone a major rework.&nbsp; Users of
the marker infrastructure will be broken by these changes as in general
deprecations were not possible.&nbsp; See below for details.</li>

<li>
The notion of <i>root resource</i> was introduced.&nbsp; See below for
details.</li>

<li>
ISyncPartner was providing little value and has been deprecated.&nbsp;
Sync partners are now identified only by their QualifiedName</li>

<li>
ILocation was providing little value and has been removed. Use URL instead.</li>

<li>
IProjectBuildSpec has been replaced with ICommand[].</li>

<li>
IWorkspace.getDefaultContentLocation(IProject) was a confusing duplicate
of&nbsp; IProject.getLocation() and has been removed.</li>

<li>
Introduced a depth parameter on IResource.accept() for added flexibility.&nbsp;
accept(IResourceVisitor, boolean) has been deprecated.</li>

<li>
IResource.isAncestorOf() was providing little value and has been deprecated.&nbsp;
Use resource.getFullPath().isPrefixOf(IPath)</li>

<li>
IActivity.unspecifiedChange is deprecated. It has been replaced by IActivity.checkIn
with a new boolean flag. The old method checkIn without the boolean flag
has been deprecated as well.</li>

<li>
IActivity.getCheckedInResources is deprecated. It has been replaced by
IActivity.getCommittedResources. Similarly for isCheckedIn -> isCommitted.</li>

<li>
new methods in IActivity - move() and remove().</li>

<li>
IActivityListener interface has changed - it uses an event object and only
one method that should be implemented by listeners. Certain events can
now be vetoed by activity listeners.</li>

<li>
IWorkspace.openActivity is deprecated. It has been replaced by IWorkspace.createActivity.</li>

<li>
IRepository.createCompareManagerPlaceholder() was deleted. A two-way compare
would use handles (IRepositoryEdition).</li>

<li>
ISharingManager.setTransient and .isTransient(): added a notion of transient
resources (i.e. not under version control). Resources are transient by
default.</li>

<li>
The spec for ISharingManager.load has been updated - shallow resource editions
cannot be passed to load().</li>

<li>
ISubscriber.confirmMerge is deprecated, is has been replaced by ISubscriber.clearIncomingChange().
There is a new method ISubscriber.clearOutgoingChange().</li>

<li>
The spec for ISubscriber.loadIfIncoming has been updated - all loads by
loadIfIncoming are shallow.</li>

<h4>
Root resource change details</h4>
The main issue behind the addition of the root resource (IWorkspaceRoot)
was the desire to unify function and features of resources with the global
nature of the workspace.&nbsp; For example, users would like to attach
properties to the workspace as a whole.&nbsp; Previously this was accomplished
using null to indicate "no resource" aka "the workspace" in API such as
makers.&nbsp; Another example was developers wanting to treat the workspace
as an IContainer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following changes were made in adding
the root resource:
<ul>
<li>
IWorkspace.getRoot() was added</li>

<li>
IContainer.getFile(String) and getFolder(String) were moved to both IProject
and IFolder.&nbsp; IWorkspaceRoot is an IContainer and cannot accomodate
these methods.</li>

<li>
The following methods on IWorkspace have been deprecated and replaced with
the appropriate method on IWorkspaceRoot: getFile(), getFolder(), getProject(),
getProjects(), findResource(), findResource().</li>

<li>
IMarkers, IResourceDelta and ISynchronizer were all updated to use IWorkspaceRoots
(rather than null) to represent the workspace as a whole.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Marker&nbsp; change details</h4>
The main issue behind the marker changes is that the original marker story
was closed. Several teams have requested changes or the ability to extend
the marker set. We saw this as a growing trend. To resolve this, we have
opened the model in the following ways:
<ul>
<li>
All markers are exposed through a generic IMarker</li>

<li>
IMarkerManager has been eliminated.&nbsp; Its functionality has been split
between IWorkspace and IResource as appropriate.</li>

<li>
IMarker provides (id, resource and type) as standard fields</li>

<li>
All other fields are accessed using getAttribute(String key), setAttribute(String
key, Object value) (and friends)</li>

<li>
Valid marker attribute values are String, Integer and Boolean</li>

<li>
The platform persists all markers</li>

<li>
Core provides a lightweight, extensible "marker type hierarchy" mechanism
where marker definers declare a&nbsp; marker's "type" relative to other
markers in the plugin.xml</li>

<li>
Marker types marked as "transient" (in their defining plugin.xml) are not
persisted</li>

<li>
IMarkers now have "handle" characteristics. That is, the need to get a
mutable copy before doing changes is gone.&nbsp; This is very much like
IResources.</li>

<li>
Marker ids are now relative to a particular resource (so a marker is expressed
as "marker #X on resource "/foo")</li>

<li>
IMarkers are IAdaptable</li>

<li>
The platform provides four pre-defined marker types: marker, problem, task
and bookmark.</li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000">Below is the XML markup required to declare some
of the predefined markers:</font>
<pre><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;extension id="marker" point="com.ibm.eclipse.core.resources.markers"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;extension id="problemmarker" point="com.ibm.eclipse.core.resources.markers">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;transient value=false/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;super type="com.ibm.eclipse.core.resources.marker"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;attribute name="message"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;attribute name="severity"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/extension></font></pre>
<font color="#000000">Given the standard marker types, below is the XML
markup required to some example markers in a plug-in called com.markers.r.us:</font>
<pre><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;extension id="coolmarker" point="com.ibm.eclipse.core.resources.markers"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;extension id="coolproblem" point="com.ibm.eclipse.core.resources.markers">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;super type="com.ibm.eclipse.core.resources.marker"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;super type="com.markers.r.us.coolmarker"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;attribute name="coolFactor"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/extension></font></pre>
Marker users should be aware that the implementation is in-progress.&nbsp;
Marker persistence is known to not work at this time.

<h4>
Debugging class loading problems</h4>
In Eclipse, each plug-in has an associated class loader handling only classes,
resources and natives from that plug-in. In addition to base loading function,
the loaders also filter access based on the &lt;export> specification in
the plugin.xml. They also support a "downstream" delegation model based
on the &lt;requires> specification in the plugin.xml. On top of this, separate
plug-ins may be loading different versions of the same class. Needless
to say, trying to figure out why you are getting ClassNotFoundException
can sometimes be a bit tricky.
<p>The loader and the plug-in registry support are instrumented with degug
trace calls that can be activated using debug flags. The flags are stored
in a .options file located in the project_resources/ directory in VA/Java,
or the working directory from which the jdk version of Eclipse was launched.
When debugging, Eclipse needs to be launched with the -debug option (if
not specified, the .options file is ignored). The following flags are defined
for the loader/ plug-in registry support:

<h4>
Running plug-ins inside VA/Java</h4>
When running inside VA/Java, plug-ins must specify which VA/Java projects
make up the plug-in runtime. This information is specified in .va.properties
file placed in the plug-in directory (as a peer to plugin.xml). The .va.properties
file is used together with the plugin.xml file to determine the class search
path for each plug-in.
<p>The properties file has entries corresponding to &lt;library> elements
from the plugin.xml. Each defined property is of form
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&nbsp; projects[.libname]=proj1,proj2,proj3</tt>
<p>The optional ".libname" suffix allows a project mapping to be specified
for the corresponding &lt;library>. The default "projects=" (w/o suffix)
applies to the first/ only &lt;library> element in plugin.xml. Example:
<p><tt>plugin.xml</tt>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;runtime>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;library name=baseapi.jar>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;export name="*"/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/library>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;library name=another.jar/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;library name=base.jar/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/runtime></pre>

<p><br><tt>.va.properties</tt>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; projects=Base API Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; projects.base.jar=Base Project 1, Base Project 2</pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp; or
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; projects.baseapi.jar=Base API Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; projects.base.jar=Base Project 1, Base Project 2</pre>

<p><br>The above results in a plug-in loader search path consisting of
<ol>
<li>
Base API Project</li>

<li>
another.jar</li>

<li>
Base Project 1, Base Project 2</li>
</ol>
Any library access filters specified in the plugin.xml are applied to the
corresponding loader search path entries
<h4>
Plug-in use of JNI natives</h4>
JNI native libraries can now be placed inside their corresponding plug-in
directory. Plug-in class loaders look inside the plug-in directory first,
and only defer to the default load path if the library is not found in
the plug-in directory. Note, that if the JNI natives make references to
other native libraries, these need to be either on the default system search
path, or need to be explicitly loaded by the JNI natives (e.g., also from
the plug-in directory, or other location of choice).
