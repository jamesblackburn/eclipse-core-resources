 * This class is temporary only. It is only a hack because some old files do not have the
 * version number in it. It should be removed when we guarantee that all users of the platform
 * are running with versioned files.
 * Its going to happen at the same time we fix the version number of the files from the
 * "random numbers" to 1, 2, 3, 4...
