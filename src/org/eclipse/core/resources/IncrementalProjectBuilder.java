 * <li>may implement other methods</li>
 * <li>must supply a public, no-argument constructor</li>

 * Runs this builder on the given changes in the specified manner.
 * Subclasses should implement this method to do the processing 
 * they require.
 * <p>
 * When invoked in response to a call to one of the <code>IProject.build</code>
 * methods, the resource delta is rooted at the project.  When invoked 
 * to do an auto-build, the kind will be <code>AUTO_BUILD</code>. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Any resource delta acquired is valid only for the duration of the invocation of this 
 * method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After completing a build, this builder may return a list of projects for
 * which it requires a resource delta the next time it is run.  This builder's project
 * is implicitly included and need not be specified.  The build mechanism
 * will attempt to maintain and compute deltas relative to the identified projects
 * when asked the next time this builder is run.  Builders must re-specify the list 
 * of interesting projects every time they are run as this is not carried forward
 * beyond the next build.  Projects mentioned in return value but which do not 
 * exist will be ignored and no delta will be made available for them.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This method is long-running; progress and cancellation are provided
 * by the given progress monitor. All builders should report their
 * progress and honor cancel requests in a timely manner.
 * Cancellation requests should be propagated to the caller by 
 * throwing <code>OperationCanceledException</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All builders should try to be robust in the face of trouble.
 * In situations where failing the build by throwing 
 * <code>CoreException</code> is the only option,
 * a builder has a choice of how best to communicate the
 * problem back to the caller. One option is to use the 
 * <code>BUILD_FAILED</code> status code along with a suitable
 * message; another is to use a multi-status containing finer-grained
 * problem diagnoses.

 * @param kind the kind of build being requested. Valid values are

 * <li> <code>AUTO_BUILD</code> - indicates an automatically triggered
 *   incremental build (auto-building on).</li>
 * </ul>

 *    (key type: <code>String</code>, value type: <code>String</code>);

 * @param monitor a progress monitor, or <code>null</code> if progress
 *    reporting and cancellation are not desired
 * @return the list of projects for which this builder would like deltas the next
 *		time it is run or <code>null</code> if none
