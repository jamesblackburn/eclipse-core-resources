/**
 * A remote mapping context provides a model element with a view of the remote state
 * of local resources as they relate to a repository operation that is in
 * progress. A repository provider can pass an instance of this interface to a
 * model element when obtaining a set of traversals for a model element. This
 * allows the model element to query the remote state of a resource in order to
 * determine if there are resources that exist remotely but do not exist locally
 * that should be included in the traversal. The traversals should also be as 
 * as possible to allow for optimization of remote operations.
 * <p>
