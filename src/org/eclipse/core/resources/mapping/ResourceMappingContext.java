/**
 * A mapping context provides a model element with a view of the remote state
 * of a local resource as it relates to a repository operation that is in
 * progress. A repository provider can pass an instance of this interface to a
 * model element when obtaining a set of traversals for a model element. This
 * allows the model element to query the remote state of a resource in order to
 * determine if there are resources that exist remotely but do not exist locally
 * that should be included in the traversal.
 * 
 * TODO Maybe call this RemoteMappingContext to differentiate it from other
 * possible context that may be introduced later?
 * 
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This API is work in progress and will likely change before the final API freeze.
