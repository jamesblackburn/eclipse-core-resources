/**
 * A resource mapping supports the transformation of an application model 
 * object into its underlying file system resources. It provides the
 * bridge between a logical element and the physical resource(s) into which it
 * is stored but does not provide more comprehensive model access or
 * manipulations.
 * <p>
 * Mappings provide two means of model traversal. The {@link #accept} method
 * can be used to visit the resources that constitute the model object. Alternatively,
 * a set or traversals can be obtained by calling {@link #getTraversals}. A traversal
 * contains a set of resources and a depth. This allows clients (such a repository providers)
 * to do optimal traversals of the resources w.r.t. the operation that is being performed
 * on the model object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class may be subclassed by clients.
 * </p>

	 * Returns one or more traversals that can be used to access all the
	 * physical resources that constitute the logical resource. A traversal is
	 * simply a set of resources and the depth to which they are to be
	 * traversed. This method returns an array of traversals in order to provide
	 * flexibility in describing the traversals that constitute a model element.
	 * <p>
	 * Subclasses should, when possible, include
	 * all resources that are or may be members of the model element. 
     * For instance, a model element should return the same list of
	 * resources regardless of the existance of the files on the file system.
	 * For example, if a logical resource called "form" maps to "/p1/form.xml"
	 * and "/p1/form.java" then whether form.xml or form.java existed, they
	 * should be returned by this method.

	 * In some cases, it may not be possible for a model element to know all the
	 * resources that may constitute the element without accessing the state of
	 * the model element in another location (e.g. a repository). This method is
	 * provided with a context which, when provided, gives access to
	 * the members of correcponding remote containers and the contenst of
	 * corresponding remote files. This gives the model element the opportunity
	 * to deduce what additional resources should be included in the traversal.

	 *            in another location. This parameter may be <code>null</code>, in
	 *            which case the implementor can assume that only the local
	 *            resources are of interest to the client.
