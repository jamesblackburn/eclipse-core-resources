/**
 * Resource change events describe changes to resources.
 * <p>
 * There are currently five different types of resource
 * change events:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *    After-the-fact batch reports of arbitrary creations, 
 *    deletions and modifications to one or more resources expressed
 *    as a hierarchical resource delta. Event type is
 *    <code>PRE_AUTO_BUILD</code>, and <code>getDelta</code> returns
 *    the hierarchical delta. The resource delta is rooted at the 
 *    workspace root.  These events are broadcast to interested parties immediately before
 *    any auto-building and happen whether or not auto-building is enabled.  The
 *	   workspace is open for change during notification of these events.	 
 *    The delta reported in this event cycle is identical across
 *    all listeners registered for this type of event.
 *    Resource changes attempted during a <code>PRE_AUTO_BUILD</code> callback
 *    <b>must</b> be done in the thread doing the notification.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *    After-the-fact batch reports of arbitrary creations, 
 *    deletions and modifications to one or more resources expressed
 *    as a hierarchical resource delta. Event type is
 *    <code>POST_AUTO_BUILD</code>, and <code>getDelta</code> returns
 *    the hierarchical delta. The resource delta is rooted at the 
 *    workspace root.  These events are broadcast to interested parties immediately after
 *    any auto-building and happen whether or not auto-building is enabled.  The
 *	   workspace is open for change during notification of these events.
 *    The delta reported in this event cycle is identical across
 *    all listeners registered for this type of event.
 *    Resource changes attempted during a <code>POST_AUTO_BUILD</code> callback
 *    <b>must</b> be done in the thread doing the notification.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *    After-the-fact batch reports of arbitrary creations, 
 *    deletions and modifications to one or more resources expressed
 *    as a hierarchical resource delta. Event type is
 *    <code>POST_CHANGE</code>, and <code>getDelta</code> returns
 *    the hierarchical delta. The resource delta is rooted at the 
 *    workspace root.  These events are broadcast to interested parties immediately after
 *    any <code>POST_AUTO_BUILD</code> events and happen whether 
 *    or not auto-building is enabled.  The workspace is closed for change during 
 *    notification of these events.
 *    The delta reported in this event cycle is identical across
 *    all listeners registered for this type of event.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *    Before-the-fact reports of the impending closure of a single
 *    project. Event type is <code>PRE_CLOSE</code>, 
 *    and <code>getResource</code> returns the project being closed.
 *    The workspace is closed for change during  notification of these events.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *    Before-the-fact reports of the impending deletion of a single
 *    project. Event type is <code>PRE_DELETE</code>, 
 *    and <code>getResource</code> returns the project being deleted.
 *    The workspace is closed for change during  notification of these events.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In order to handle additional event types that may be introduced
 * in future releases of the platform, clients should do not write code
 * that presumes the set of event types is closed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
