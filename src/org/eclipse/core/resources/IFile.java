/**
 * Sets the contents of this file to the bytes in the given file state.
 * <p>
 * The <code>FORCE</code> update flag controls how this method deals with
 * cases where the workspace is not completely in sync with the local file 
 * system. If <code>FORCE</code> is not specified, the method will only attempt
 * to overwrite a corresponding file in the local file system provided
 * it is in sync with the workspace. This option ensures there is no 
 * unintended data loss; it is the recommended setting.
 * However, if <code>FORCE</code> is specified, an attempt will be made
 * to write a corresponding file in the local file system, overwriting any
 * existing one if need be. In either case, if this method succeeds, the 
 * resource will be marked as being local (even if it wasn't before).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>KEEP_HISTORY</code> update flag controls whether or not a copy of
 * current contents of this file should be captured in the workspace's local
 * history (properties are not recorded in the local history). The local history
 * mechanism serves as a safety net to help the user recover from mistakes that
 * might otherwise result in data loss. Specifying <code>KEEP_HISTORY</code>
 * is recommended except in circumstances where past states of the files are of
 * no conceivable interested to the user. Note that local history is maintained
 * with each individual project, and gets discarded when a project is deleted
 * from the workspace.
