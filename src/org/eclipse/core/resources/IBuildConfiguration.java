/**
 * Build Configurations provide a mechanism for orthogonal configuration specific
 * builds within a single project.  The resources plugin maintains build deltas per
 * interested builder, per configuration, and allow build configurations to reference
 * each other.
 *<p>
 * All projects have at least one build configuration.  By default this
 * has Id {@link #DEFAULT_CONFIG_ID}.  One configuration in the project is defined 
 * to be 'active'. The active configuration is built by default.  If unset, the
 * active configuration defaults to the first configuration in the project.
 *</p>
 *<p>
 * Build configurations are created with:
 * {@link IWorkspace#newBuildConfiguration(String, String, String)}, and
 * set on a project using {@link IProjectDescription#setBuildConfigurations(IBuildConfiguration[])}.
 * Build configurations set on Projects must have unique non-null configuration Ids.
 *</p>
 *<p>
 * When a project is built, a specific configuration is built. This configuration
 * is passed to the builders so they can adapt their behavior
 * appropriately. Builders which don't care about configurations may ignore this,
 * and work as before.
 *</p>
 *<p>
 * Build configuration can reference other builds configurations.  These references are 
 * set using {@link IProjectDescription#setDynamicConfigReferences(String, IBuildConfiguration[])}.
 * The reference may have a <code>null</code> configuration Id which is resolved to the 
 * referenced project's current active build configuration at build time.
 *</p>
 *<p> 
 * Workspace build will ensure that the projects are built in an appropriate order as defined
 * by the reference graph.
 *</p>
