<h1>
The Project Description File</h1></center>
<b><i>Description:</i></b> When a project is created in the workspace,
a project description file is automatically generated that describes the
project.&nbsp; The purpose of this file is to make the project self-describing,
so that a project that is zipped up or released to a server can be correctly
recreated in another workspace.&nbsp; This file is always called ".project",
and is located as a direct member of the project's content area.&nbsp;
The name of the file is exposed through the static field <tt>DESCRIPTION_FILE_NAME</tt>
on <tt>org.eclipse.core.resources.IProjectDescription.</tt>
<p>The name, location, and content of this file are part of the workspace
API.&nbsp; This means they are guaranteed not to change in a way that would
break existing users of the file.&nbsp; However, the right to add additional
elements and attributes to the markup is reserved for possible future additions
to the file.&nbsp; For this reason, clients that read the description file
contents should tolerate unknown elements and attributes.
<p>Clients that modify, delete, or replace the project description file
do so at their own risk.&nbsp; Projects with invalid or missing description
files will not be generally usable.&nbsp; If projects with invalid descriptions
are discovered on workspace startup, they are closed, and it will not be
possible to open the file until the project description file has been repaired.&nbsp;
The workspace will not generally attempt to automatically repair missing
or deleted description file.&nbsp; One exception is that missing project
description files will be regenerated during workspace save and on calls
to <tt>IProject.setDescription</tt>.
<p>Modifications to the project description file have mostly the same effect
as changing the project description via <tt>IProject.setDescription</tt>.&nbsp;
One exception is that adding or removing project natures will not trigger
the corresponding nature's configure or deconfigure method.&nbsp; Another
exception is that changes to the project name are ignored.
<p>If a new project is created at a location that contains an existing
project description file, the contents of that description file will be
honoured as the project description.&nbsp; One exception is that the project
name in the file will be ignored if it does not match the name of the project
being created.&nbsp; If the description file on disk is invalid, the project
creation will fail.
